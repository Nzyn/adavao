# Evidence (Photo/Video) Requirements

This guide describes what media is acceptable when submitting a report in the AlertDavao mobile app.

## What to Upload

Upload media that helps validate the incident:
- Damage (vehicle, property, injuries)
- Scene context (street signs, landmarks)
- Suspect/vehicle details (plate number, clothing, distinguishing marks)
- Proof that the incident is recent (e.g., time-sensitive context like crowds/emergency response)

## Accepted Types

The app supports uploading either:
- Photos (recommended for clarity)
- Videos (recommended for moving situations or to capture context)

## Quality Guidelines (Recommended)

- **Clear and in-focus**: Blurry images are hard to verify.
- **Good lighting**: Avoid extremely dark footage.
- **Stable framing**: Hold steady; avoid rapid panning.
- **Include context**: A close-up plus a wider shot is ideal.

## Privacy & Safety

- **Do not upload** private information (IDs, addresses, financial details).
- **Avoid doxxing** and unnecessary exposure of uninvolved civilians.
- **Do not put yourself in danger** to obtain footage.

## Common Reasons Evidence Gets Rejected

- Media is unrelated to the incident.
- Media is too blurry/dark to verify.
- Duplicate/spam uploads.
- Edited/manipulated media.

## Tips

- If you can only upload one item, choose the clearest photo.
- If uploading video, keep it short and focused (10–30 seconds is usually enough).
